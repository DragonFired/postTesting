The problem is very repeatable, but the behavior is bizarre. I was trying to guard the line with a boolean that would turn off and on the issue, in this process I discovered that when I removed a comment from a line of code that WON'T get executed, the code breaks! ðŸ¤¯

    I am assuming that this is some kind of memory or memory allocation problem, but it is still quite a mystery to me!
